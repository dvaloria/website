    				<h2> About Me </h2>
    				<p> Hello students and families! My name is Daniel Valoria, and I am in my third year of teaching at Grossmont High School. I graduated from GHS in 2016, so it has been wonderful giving back to the community that made me who I am today, and I want to continue paying it forward. I graduated with my Masters in Teaching Math and Science Education from SDSU, where I also earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. In addition, I am a football coach for our boys' JV team. I played football for GHS all four years I was a student there, and I am excited to restore the pride and culture that I experienced as a player. As part of G-Crew, I help students become leaders and give back to their community, as they show our incoming Freshmen what it means to be a Foothiller.  </p>

				<p> I am passionate about teaching and doing what is best for kids. Because of this, our team is constantly looking for research and attending professional development in order to find the most equitable and effective teaching practices. Through this exploration and learning, we have implemented a grading system and curriculum that prioritizes understanding, not student behaviors, such as completing homework or memorizing information for a test. </p>

    				<p> Pictured here is our dog, Ellie, who is only a few months old, but already quite the handful! She is such a sweet puppy with lots of personality, but I cannot wait for her to stop teething and be potty trained. If you have any questions about your student, grades, or anything else, please contact me using the information below, and I will get back to you as soon as Ellie allows me to! </p>
